# 虚假新闻检测
虚假新闻在社交媒体和新闻平台上⼴泛存在，其对公众观念和舆论产⽣了深远影响。本项目旨在通过探索虚假新闻的分类⽅法来使我们了解部分机器学习算法和⾃然语⾔处理技术。我们已收集一些数据并用这些数据来训练模型，以实现对新闻真实性的判断。通过此实验，我们希望不仅能够对Python机器学习等⽅⾯有所了解，也能够探索到相对有效的虚假新闻检测⽅法。
The proliferation of fake news on social media and news platforms has had a profound impact on public perception and opinion. The aim of this project is to understand some of the machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques by exploring ways to categorize fake news. We have collected some data and used them to train a model to realize the judgment of news authenticity. Through this experiment, we hope to not only gain an understanding of Python machine learning and other aspects, but also explore a relatively effective method for detecting fake news.
